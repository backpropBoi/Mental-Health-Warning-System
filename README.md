Mental Health Text Classification: Depression Detection from Reddit Posts
<br>
This repository contains a machine learning project focused on detecting depression from Reddit posts using natural language processing (NLP) and deep learning techniques. The goal is to build and evaluate models that can classify whether a given Reddit post indicates depression, leveraging a real-world, anonymized dataset.

Project Overview
This project aims to identify signs of depression in Reddit posts using machine learning. By analyzing user-generated text, the models attempt to classify whether a post reflects depressive symptoms. The main motivation is to explore how NLP and deep learning can support early detection of mental health issues in online communities.
